# Joseph Holler's Open Source GIS Porfolio
Hi, I am Joseph Holler and I am super enthusiasic about teaching the second round of Open Source GIScience.
I really shouldn't put information like "second round" in this video, because it'll be super lame when I try to re-use the video next year.

## GIScience Analyses

1. [Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction](gravity/gravity.md)
1. another future analysis

## Musings

1. [What is Open GIScience?](musings/open-source.md)
